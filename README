This is an AI optimization tool for building the GEO-MAP and finding the distance between any two nodes for the Engergy Grid network.
Developed for one of the energy tranmission companies in Australia (customer's data is not uploaded)

input file:feeder.csv which is the map information which has the two adjacent pionts names and their distance.
e.g.,
Node 1,Node 2,l [km]
1,2,10
3,2,100
4,2,15
4,5,17
6,4,22
4,7,103
7,8,44
7,9,67
9,10,10
13,10,100
10,11,10
11,12,102
14,11,200
15,14,401
15,16,106
16,17,211
18,16,76
18,19,35
19,20,53


Output: 
1. The topoloy of the map base on the input
2. The path from start node (1 in above example) to each of the nodes (2,3,4,5,.....20)
3. The length from the start (1 in above example) to each of the nodes (2,3,4,5,.....20)


1. put your data file (feeder.csv) into the same directory as codes;
2. Run "./feeder.py feeder.csv path" which will generate 'solution' file in the same directory, which is the the path from start node (1 in above example) to each of the nodes (2,3,4,5,.....20);
3. Run "./feeder.py feeder.csv node" which will generate 'connectNode' file in the same directory, which is the topoloy of the map base on the input;
4. Run "./calcLen.py feeder.csv sum" which will generate 'solutionLenSum' file in the same directory, which is the length from the start (1 in above example) to each of the nodes (2,3,4,5,.....20);
5. Run "./calcLen.py feeder.csv path" which will generate 'solutionLen' file in the same directory, which give each section's length in the path from the start to each of the nodes.
